Exploring Unemployment and Video Gambling data 
This project is For my IS 470 class, it is an R based Projects. The project was ment to compare vidoe gambling data and unemployment data. All of the data Illinois based, I found the video gambing data on Illinois Gambling Board https://www.igb.illinois.gov/videoreports.aspx. For the Unemployment data I got it from the Illinois Deparment of Employment Security https://www2.illinois.gov/ides/LMI/Pages/Historical_Monthly_Annual_Data.aspx. This project also has visualizations that I also created in R. The visualizations campare diffrent aspects of each table to show if the unemployment rate and video gambling are related. This project was alot of fun I hope someone can benifit from this.
